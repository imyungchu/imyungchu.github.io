## Description
It's a basic and simple static website powered by GitHub.

## Future Work
I am planning to complete the following tasks:
- Build a better personal website using Hexo or Hugo.
- Write more articles (e.g., technical, experiential, and learning) on my website.
- Organizing my diary entities and learning processes and publish them.
